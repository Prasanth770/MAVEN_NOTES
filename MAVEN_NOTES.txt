→Maven 
Maven is a software project management and comprehension tool. Based on the concept of a project object model (POM), Maven can manage a project's build, reporting and documentation from a central piece of information. Development team can automate the project's build infrastructure in almost no time as Maven uses a standard directory layout and a default build lifecycle.
* Maven is a powerful project management tool that is based on POM (project object model). It is used for projects build, dependency and documentation


→The primary goal of Maven is to provide developer with the following −
* A comprehensive model for projects, which is reusable, maintainable, and easier to comprehend.
* Plugins or tools that interact with this declarative model.
Maven project structure and contents are declared in an xml file, pom.xml, referred as Project Object Model (POM), which is the fundamental unit of the entire Maven system. In later chapters, we will explain POM in detail.
→What is a Maven Repository?
In Maven terminology, a repository is a directory where all the project jars, library jar, plugins or any other project specific artifacts are stored and can be used by Maven easily.
→Maven Commands:
* mvn clean: Cleans the project and removes all files generated by the previous build.
* mvn compile: Compiles source code of the project.
* mvn test-compile: Compiles the test source code.
* mvn test: Runs tests for the project.
* mvn package: Creates JAR or WAR file for the project to convert it into a distributable format.
* mvn install: Deploys the packaged JAR/ WAR file to the local repository.
* mvn deploy: Copies the packaged JAR/ WAR file to the remote repository after compiling, running tests and building the project.
→What is artifact and group ID in Maven?
Maven uses a set of identifiers, also called coordinates, to uniquely identify a project and specify how the project artifact should be packaged: 
groupId – a unique base name of the company or group that created the project. artifactId – a unique name of the project. version – a version of the project


→What is POM file in Maven?
A Project Object Model or POM is the fundamental unit of work in Maven. It is an XML file that contains information about the project and configuration details used by Maven to build the project.


* POM stands for Project Object Model. It is fundamental unit of work in Maven. It is an XML file that resides in the base directory of the project as pom.xml.
*  The POM contains information about the project and various configuration detail used by Maven to build the project(s)
* . POM also contains the goals and plugins. While executing a task or goal, Maven looks for the POM in the current directory.
*  It reads the POM, gets the needed configuration information, and then executes the goal. Some of the configuration that can be specified in the POM are following:  
* project dependencies  plugins  goals  build profiles  project version  developers  mailing list Before creating a POM, we should first decide the project group (groupId), its name (artifactId) and its version as these attributes help in uniquely identifying the project in repository.


→Maven Lifecycle:
Validate, Compile, Test, Package, Integration test, Verify, Install and Deploy.


Advantages of Maven
* Helps manage all the processes, such as building, documentation, releasing, and distribution in project management
* Simplifies the process of project building
* Increases the performance of the project and the building process
* The task of downloading Jar files and other dependencies is done automatically
* Provides easy access to all the required information 
* Makes it easy for the developer to build a project in different environments without worrying about the dependencies, processes, etc.
